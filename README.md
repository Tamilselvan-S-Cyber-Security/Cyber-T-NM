#### üìñ Detailed Explanation

**Phase 1: Entry Point & Authentication**
- **User Opens Cyber-T**: The application initializes and loads essential security services in the background
- **Authentication Layer**: Before accessing any functionality, users must pass through a secure PIN validation system, ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive security features

**Phase 2: Main Dashboard**
The dashboard serves as the central command center, providing:
- **Real-time Threat Status**: Live updates on current security state
- **Active Protection Modules**: Visual indicators showing which security features are running
- **Recent Security Events**: Historical log of detected threats and actions taken

**Phase 3: Security Modules** (Parallel Processing)
Six independent but interconnected modules run simultaneously:

1. **Threat Scanner**: Performs deep system scans to detect malware, trojans, and malicious applications
2. **Call Filter**: Monitors incoming calls against spam databases and suspicious number patterns
3. **Website Checker**: Validates URLs in real-time to protect against phishing and malicious sites
4. **App Permissions**: Analyzes installed apps and flags excessive or suspicious permission requests
5. **Spam Filter**: Identifies and blocks spam messages using AI-powered pattern recognition
6. **WhatsApp Alerts**: Manages notification delivery to user's registered WhatsApp number

**Phase 4: Central Security Analysis Engine**
All module data flows into this core processing unit that executes:

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregates information from all active security modules
2. **Threat Pattern Matching**: Compares collected data against known threat signatures and behavioral patterns
3. **Risk Assessment**: Calculates threat severity scores using machine learning algorithms
4. **Alert Generation**: Determines appropriate response actions based on threat level

**Phase 5: Decision & Action**
The engine makes a critical decision:

- **If Threat Detected** (Red Path):
  - **Block Action**: Immediately prevents the threat from executing
  - **Notify User**: Sends in-app notification with threat details
  - **Send WhatsApp Alert**: Triggers external notification for critical threats
  - **Log Incident**: Records complete threat information for future analysis

- **If System Clean** (Green Path):
  - **Continue Monitoring**: Maintains active surveillance without interruption
  - **Update Status**: Refreshes dashboard to show current safe state

#### üìã Step-by-Step Process

| Step | Process | Description | Technical Details |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **User Launch** | User taps the Cyber-T app icon | App initializes security services in background |
| 2 | **PIN Validation** | User enters 4-6 digit PIN | Encrypted PIN comparison using SHA-256 hashing |
| 3 | **PIN Check** | System validates entered PIN | Max 3 attempts before 30-second lockout |
| 4a | **Valid PIN** | PIN matches stored hash | Proceed to optional biometric check |
| 4b | **Invalid PIN** | PIN doesn't match | Display error message, allow retry |
| 5 | **Biometric Check** | Fingerprint or Face ID scan | Uses device native biometric APIs |
| 6a | **Biometric Success** | Biometric authentication passed | Grant full dashboard access |
| 6b | **Biometric Skip** | User chooses to skip | PIN-only authentication accepted |
| 6c | **Biometric Fail** | Biometric doesn't match | Return to PIN validation |
| 7 | **Dashboard Access** | User successfully authenticated | Load personalized dashboard and settings |

#### üîí Security Features

#### üìã Multi-Layer Analysis Process

| Layer | Check Type | What It Validates | Detection Capability |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **SSL Certificate** | HTTPS, Valid cert, Cert authority | Fake certificates, expired SSL |
| 2 | **Domain Reputation** | Age, registrar, history, similarity | Newly registered, typosquatting |
| 3 | **Content Matching** | Page structure, forms, branding | Clone sites, fake login pages |
| 4 | **AI Analysis** | Behavioral patterns, anomalies | Zero-day phishing, novel attacks |
| 5 | **Final Verdict** | Combined risk assessment | Overall threat determination |

#### üîí Security Checks Explained

**1. SSL Certificate Validation**
```
Checks Performed:
‚úì HTTPS protocol enforcement
‚úì Certificate validity period
‚úì Trusted Certificate Authority
‚úì Domain name match in certificate
‚úì Certificate revocation status
‚úì Encryption strength (TLS 1.2+)

Red Flags:
‚úó No HTTPS (HTTP only)
‚úó Self-signed certificates
‚úó Expired certificates
‚úó Domain mismatch
‚úó Weak encryption (SSLv3, TLS 1.0)
```

**2. Domain Reputation Analysis**
- **Age Verification**: New domains (<30 days) flagged
- **Typosquatting Detection**: Similar to popular sites (g00gle.com vs google.com)
- **Blacklist Check**: Known phishing domains database
- **WHOIS Privacy**: Hidden registration = higher suspicion
- **Geographic Mismatch**: Server location vs claimed location
- **Subdomain Abuse**: Suspicious subdomains (paypal-secure.fake-site.com)

**3. Content Pattern Matching**
```javascript
Phishing Indicators:
‚Ä¢ Login forms on non-HTTPS pages
‚Ä¢ Requests for sensitive data (SSN, card numbers)
‚Ä¢ Mismatched branding (wrong logos, fonts)
‚Ä¢ Urgent language ("Account suspended", "Verify now")
‚Ä¢ Suspicious URL parameters (?login=fake)
‚Ä¢ Multiple redirects before landing page
‚Ä¢ Embedded iframes from different domains
‚Ä¢ Disabled right-click or copy functions
```

**4. AI-Based Behavioral Scan**
Machine learning models analyze:
- Visual similarity to legitimate sites (screenshot comparison)
- Page structure and HTML patterns
- JavaScript behavior and function calls
- External resource loading patterns
- User input handling methods

#### üìã Permission Analysis Pipeline

| Stage | Process | Analysis Performed | Decision Time |
|-------|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | **App Install/Update** | Detect new permission requests | Instant |
| 2 | **Interception** | Capture permission manifest | <10ms |
| 3 | **Necessity Analysis** | Check if permission makes sense for app type | <50ms |
| 4 | **Category Check** | Compare against app category norms | <30ms |
| 5 | **Risk Assessment** | Calculate privacy risk score | <40ms |
| 6 | **User Notification** | Display appropriate warning level | Immediate |

#### üîç Permission Categories & Risk Levels

```

#### üéØ Smart Context Analysis

**App Category vs Expected Permissions**

| App Type | Expected Permissions | Suspicious If Requests |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Flashlight** | CAMERA (flash), WAKE_LOCK | SMS, CONTACTS, LOCATION |
| **Calculator** | VIBRATE, INTERNET (ads) | CAMERA, MICROPHONE, SMS |
| **Photo Editor** | CAMERA, STORAGE, INTERNET | SMS, CALL_LOG, CONTACTS |
| **Messaging** | SMS, CONTACTS, CAMERA, STORAGE | FINE_LOCATION, INSTALL_PACKAGES |
